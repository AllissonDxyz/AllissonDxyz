#### *Hello, I'm a passionate learner of programming, design, and modeling, always on a quest to expand my knowledge. I find immense joy in making substantial contributions to projects, which has led me to take on the role of Project Manager in a few lesser-known but equally exciting endeavors.

##### I take great pleasure in collaborating with streamers, applying my design and study skills to enhance their broadcasts. Some of the wonderful individuals I've had the privilege to assist include HaninhaFer and MammyNoob. I'm constantly seeking fresh challenges and opportunities to make a positive impact in the realms of technology and entertainment.*

### ✨・a little about myself...
