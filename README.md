#### <italic>Hello, I'm a passionate learner of programming, design, and modeling, always on a quest to expand my knowledge. I find immense joy in making substantial contributions to projects, which has led me to take on the role of Project Manager in a few lesser-known but equally exciting endeavors.</italic>

##### I take great pleasure in collaborating with streamers, applying my design and study skills to enhance their broadcasts. Some of the wonderful individuals I've had the privilege to assist include [HaninhaFer](https://twitch.tv/haninhafer) and [MammyNoob](https://twitch.mammynoob.com). I'm constantly seeking fresh challenges and opportunities to make a positive impact in the realms of technology and entertainment.
